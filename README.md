# Tickytacky Examples

This uses the [tickytacky library](https://github.com/numbertheory/tickytacky) to
run this game.

This is a work in progress to show off the capabilities of the library.

## Installing and running

Create a virtualenv, running Python3:

```
mkvirtualenv --python=$(which python3) tickytacky-game
```

Then, install the library:

```
pip install tickytacky
```

Finally, run the game:

```
python game.py
```

The `examples/` folder contains one-off script demos which can also be run.
